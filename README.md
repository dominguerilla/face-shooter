# face-shooter
A VR shooter game, inspired by the first level of Bayonetta 1. Built for the HTC Vive.

Guns are spawned and launched at the player, who must catch and use them to defend themselves from waves of incoming face monsters. Each gun is either red or blue, and will do more damage to enemies with the same color.
The player can hold down Trigger and move their hands to catch the guns in midair. However, the player can perform a 'perfect equip' if they press Trigger just as the gun touches their hands, which turns the gun purple and allows them to deal full damage against all enemies regardless of color.
